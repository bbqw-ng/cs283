 * start_server(ifaces, port, is_threaded)

 *              where the server will bind.  In almost all cases it will
 *              be the default "0.0.0.0" which binds to all interfaces.
 *              note the constant RDSH_DEF_SVR_INTFACE in rshlib.h
 * 
 *      port:   The port the server will use.  Note the constant 
 *              RDSH_DEF_PORT which is 1234 in rshlib.h.  If you are using
 *              tux you may need to change this to your own default, or even
 *              better use the command line override -s implemented in dsh_cli.c
 *              For example ./dsh -s 0.0.0.0:5678 where 5678 is the new port  
 * 
 *      is_threded:  Used for extra credit to indicate the server should implement
 *                   per thread connections for clients  
 *

 *          1. Booting up the server
 *          2. Processing client requests until the client requests the
 *             server to stop by running the `stop-server` command
 *          3. Stopping the server. 
 * 
 *      This function is fully implemented for you and should not require
 *      any changes for basic functionality.  
 * 
 *      IF YOU IMPLEMENT THE MULTI-THREADED SERVER FOR EXTRA CREDIT YOU NEED
 *      TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE is_threaded ARGUMENT HOWEVER.

 * 
 *      This function "boots" the rsh server.  It is responsible for all
 *      socket operations prior to accepting client connections.  Specifically: 
 * 
 *      1. Create the server socket using the socket() function. 
 *      2. Calling bind to "bind" the server to the interface and port
 *      3. Calling listen to get the server ready to listen for connections.

 *      include the following code:

 *   
 *  This function handles managing client connections.  It does this using
 *  the following logic
 * 
 *      1.  Starts a while(1) loop:
 *  
 *          a. Calls accept() to wait for a client connection. Recall that 
 *             the accept() function returns another socket specifically
 *             bound to a client connection. 
 *          b. Calls exec_client_requests() to handle executing commands
 *             sent by the client. It will use the socket returned from
 *             accept().
 *          c. Loops back to the top (step 2) to accept connecting another
 *             client.  
 * 
 *          note that the exec_client_requests() return code should be
 *          negative if the client requested the server to stop by sending
 *          the `stop-server` command.  If this is the case step 2b breaks
 *          out of the while(1) loop. 
 * 
 *      2.  After we exit the loop, we need to cleanup.  Dont forget to 
 *          free the buffer you allocated in step #1.  Then call stop_server()
 *          to close the server socket. 
 * 
 *  Returns:
 * 
 *      OK_EXIT:  When the client sends the `stop-server` command this function
 *                should return OK_EXIT. 
 * 
 *      ERR_RDSH_COMMUNICATION:  This error code terminates the loop and is
 *                returned from this function in the case of the accept() 
 *                function failing. 
 * 
 *      OTHERS:   See exec_client_requests() for return codes.  Note that positive
 *                values will keep the loop running to accept additional client
 *                connections, and negative values terminate the server.

 * exec_client_requests(cli_socket)
 *      cli_socket:  The server-side socket that is connected to the client
 *   
 *  This function handles accepting remote client commands. The function will
 *  loop and continue to accept and execute client commands.  There are 2 ways
 *  that this ongoing loop accepting client commands ends:
 * 
 *      1.  When the client executes the `exit` command, this function returns
 *          to process_cli_requests() so that we can accept another client
 *          connection. 
 *      2.  When the client executes the `stop-server` command this function
 *          returns to process_cli_requests() with a return code of OK_EXIT
 *          indicating that the server should stop. 
 * 
 *  Note that this function largely follows the implementation of the
 *  exec_local_cmd_loop() function that you implemented in the last 
 *  shell program deliverable. The main difference is that the command will
 *  arrive over the recv() socket call rather than reading a string from the
 *  keyboard. 
 * 
 *  This function also must send the EOF character after a command is
 *  successfully executed to let the client know that the output from the
 *  command it sent is finished.  Use the send_message_eof() to accomplish 
 *  this. 
 * 
 *  Of final note, this function must allocate a buffer for storage to 
 *  store the data received by the client. For example:
 *     io_buff = malloc(RDSH_COMM_BUFF_SZ);
 *  And since it is allocating storage, it must also properly clean it up
 *  prior to exiting.
 * 
 *  Returns:
 * 
 *      OK:       The client sent the `exit` command.  Get ready to connect
 *                another client. 
 *      OK_EXIT:  The client sent `stop-server` command to terminate the server
 * 
 *      ERR_RDSH_COMMUNICATION:  A catch all for any socket() related send
 *                or receive errors.
